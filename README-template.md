I learn a lot here. Even I already know the basi knowledge of html and css, but frontend mentor make me learn a lot in development workflow like a dev. Like reading the requirement, observing design, making project from scratch, until deploy it live.

Here i learn some of new knowledge for media query.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  .card {
    max-width: 90vw;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 600px) {
  .card {
    max-width: 375px;
    padding: 24px;
    border-radius: 15px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .card {
    max-width: 375px;
    padding: 32px;
    border-radius: 20px;
  }
